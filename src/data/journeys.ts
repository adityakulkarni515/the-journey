    introduction:
      "This trip was supposed to be solo. I had planned everything myself, mapped out the cities, booked the flights. Then I asked my friends Prathamesh and Prajwal if they wanted to join — and somehow, against all odds, they made it. It was also our FIRST FLIGHT EXPERIENCE EVER — and we didn't just fly once, we experienced two completely different aircraft on day one: the propeller-driven ATR and the jet-powered Airbus A320. What started as a solo adventure turned into a 10-day odyssey through the spiritual heart of India, from the burning ghats of Banaras to the white marble of Taj Mahal, with bhang thandai and Banarasi paan fueling our philosophical debates along the way. The paan became as much a ritual as the bhang — consumed constantly, made by artists who sold their craft for just ₹7.",
    whyIWent:
      "I wanted to see Banaras — the city that has fascinated me since I first read about it. The oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. A place where death is celebrated, where life and mortality dance together on the ghats every single day. The Taj Mahal and Delhi were additions, but Banaras was the real calling.",

The flames illuminated everything in orange. We stood there, watching bodies turn to ash, watching families grieve, watching workers casually ask for the next body. And somehow, instead of horror, I felt an inexplicable peace. Death stripped of all drama, reduced to its essence — just a body returning to elements. The worker's mundane request — 'please get me the next one, I want to finish my work' — echoed in my head for days. What is life, really?",

    introduction:
      "I used to watch moto vlogging videos on YouTube and dream about a solo Himalayan ride on my own Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 — that beautiful orange machine. When I started earning and working, the financial freedom finally came. The dream was Ladakh. I planned everything, rode from Hyderabad to Delhi — 1,580 km in just two days. And then Delhi told me the road to Ladakh wasn't open yet. The mountains had closed one door, but opened another. Spiti Valley it was. What followed was 14 days of rain, rockfalls, broken phone, broken bike stand, frozen fingers, a fall on one of the world's deadliest roads — and moments so beautiful that I still close my eyes and see them.",

      "Every rider who watches those YouTube videos dreams of the Himalayas. The winding roads, the high passes, the thin air, the solitude. I had the bike, I finally had the money, and I had two weeks. The plan was simple: ride solo to Ladakh. The universe had different plans — but Spiti turned out to be exactly what I needed. Sometimes the detour is the destination.",

Snow walls on the sides, rocks on the road, rivers flowing across your path, water crossings that test every nerve. I was riding carefully, but the road had other plans. I fell. The bike went down, I went down. For a moment, everything stopped. But I was geared up properly — no damage to me. The bike's side stand broke. I sat there, catching my breath, looking at the mountains that had just humbled me. Made an adjustment with a rope, tied up the stand, and started again toward Manali. That fall taught me more about myself than a hundred successful rides ever could.",

This time, I planned smarter — parcelled the bike from Hyderabad to Gurgaon and back, no 930 km single-day rides. A colleague heard about my plans and wanted to join. I briefed him on the itinerary, he agreed, and we began execution. What followed was 16 days through Zanskar Valley, the remotest corners of Ladakh, and finally standing at Umling La — 5,799 meters — the world's highest motorable road. The dream that was blocked in 2023 was finally accomplished.",
